Implementation Plan
1
Foundation & Pilots (12 weeks)

AI governance & HITL approvals for control changes
Data lakehouse and connectors (BMS, CRM, library)
Initial models: fault detection, grant matching, donor propensity
Monitoring & Audit (logs/metrics/trace)
Dependencies
Executive sponsor
Security review
Data access approvals
Quick Wins
30 days: Stand up platform, ingest first BMS and CRM datasets
60 days: First fault predictions and grant matches with HITL
90 days: Pilot campaigns with scored segments; early energy tuning
2
Scale & Integration (24 weeks)

Expand sensors/retrofits to additional buildings
Campaign automation with opt-in controls
MLOps with CI/CD, drift and cost monitoring
Playbooks, training, and change management
Dependencies
Pilot success metrics
Procurement for sensors
Change advisory board approvals
Quick Wins
60 days: Add 2â€“3 buildings and scale donor segments
Agentic Blueprint: Higher Ed AI Acceleration
v57
Created: 8/20/2025
Estimated Cost: Pilot budgets department-level; sensor retrofits vary by building
Timeline: 36 weeks
Executive Summary
Large higher-education institution can realize meaningful value via three AI programs: campus operations optimization, research/grant support, and advancement analytics. Start with retrofit-ready buildings and tool-assisted research flows, then scale models and integrations. Target quick wins in 90 days with governance, HITL approvals, and observability. Expect medium-to-high ROI with measured expansion.

Agent Platform Recommendation
Recommended Platform is:
Microsoft Azure AI + Power Platform + Azure IoT for Higher Ed
Leverages common higher-ed investments (Azure AD/Entra, M365). Offers Azure IoT for BMS integration, Azure ML for modeling, and Power Platform for rapid HITL apps with governance. Strong security/compliance posture.

Implementation Time:
Pilot 8â€“12 weeks; scale 6â€“12 months
Estimated Cost:
Pay-as-you-go; pilot <$100k excl. sensors
Integration Complexity:
Medium
Support Level:
Enterprise
Pros:
Tight M365/Entra ID integration
Rich IoT/ML services and tooling
Low-code HITL apps via Power Platform
Cons:
IoT/BMS integration effort varies by vendor
Cost management needs FinOps discipline
Model ops requires upskilling
Technical Requirements:
Access to BMS/IoT APIs or gateways
Central data lakehouse (e.g., ADLS/Delta)
SSO via Entra ID (SAML/OIDC)
Fine-grained RBAC and network segmentation
Alternative Options
AWS with IoT Core, SageMaker, and Connect
Pilot 8â€“12 weeks
Strong for institutions standardized on AWS or with Salesforce advancement stacks.

Cost: Usage-based; pilot similar to Azure
Complexity: Medium
Service sprawl complexity
Different identity model vs M365
Risks & Success
Key Risks
IoT integration fragility and data quality gaps

Prompt injection or insecure tool use in LLM flows

Model drift in donor and fault prediction models

User adoption lags without change management

Fundraising messaging risks reputational harm

Retrofit capex constraints delay scale

Mitigation Strategies
HITL checkpoints for any control changes; observability and rollback
OWASP LLM mitigations: sandbox tools, least privilege, output filters
MLOps with monitoring, retraining cadence, and A/B tests
Contingency Plans
Fallback to read-only alerts if controls fail
Pause campaigns and revert to standard segments
Prioritize software-only savings while deferring hardware
Success Metrics
Energy reduction on pilot buildings: Target 5â€“10 %

Increase in proposal submissions/success rate: Target 5 %

Lift in donor conversion rate: Target 2â€“4 %
